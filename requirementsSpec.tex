	\section{Introduction}
    	
        \subsection{Purpose}
        	\paragraph{The purpose of this document is to put forth a description detailing the NavUP system. It will explain the main purpose of the system, as well as additional subsystems, the interface of these systems, and what they will and will not do, as well as the constraints. Providing a detailed requirement specification of the system as a whole. It is intended for the Client, as well as developers who will integrate the system.}
    	\subsection{Scope}
        	\paragraph{NavUP will be a mobile device application, that will provide the basic functionalities of a navigation system. The system will only interoperate and function on the Hatfield main campus of the University of Pretoria.NavUp will provide a means to navigate the main campus of the University of Pretoria. It will thus provide users choices with regards to which routes they wish to take to reach there destination, taking into account factors such as pedestrian and vehicle traffic as well as providing routes that cater to users who may suffer physical disabilities.NavUP's goal is to provide a personalised, efficient and convenient means of traversing the university's Hatfield campus. The system will also provide extra additional information regarding useful points of interests such as bathroom locations, as well as provide information to the user regarding the rich history of the University of Pretoria.The navigation system will be required to constantly be connected the the campus's WI-FI and will continually send up and down stream information to a server with regards to users location and destination. The server will be required to calculate the route and factor in additional information as set up by the user and there needs. The server must also be able to handle a high volume of concurrent users and provide them all with there required data.Location tracking will be achieved through the use of --WI-FI signal strength and other : not sure of exact methodology-- techniques and not through the use of GPS. /* This means that the two way communication between the device and the server must --explain requirements here-- */ }

			\begin{itemize}
  				\item The System shall save routes created by the user.
				\item The system shall save the distance travelled, and score it for game purposes.
				\item The system shall save the distances into a leader-board database
				\item The system shall send notifications to the users based on events which occur.
				\item The system shall allow the user to store data (Preferences etc.)
				\item The system shall allow the user to rate routes/parking/points of interests
