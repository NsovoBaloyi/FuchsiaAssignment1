	Registered users will have there distance travel tallied and recorded and scored for points on the game system. These scores will get bonuses and boosts by visiting points of interests and by having the game system generate virtual pick-ups that can be found in certain random locations on campus, which will then be collected by going to those locations. As registered users use the system their scores will be posted to a scoreboard kept by the system, allowing them to view who is in the lead and their location on the board.
