{The account system will allow general users to register themselves and create accounts which will be stored and tracked by the account system. This system will therefore allow users to have access to the rating system, the game system and any other more personalised system provided by the NavUP system as a whole. The account system will allow administrative user to assign user privileges to different accounts. It will also be responsible for storing the users preferences on the server as well as any other data they might enter into the system such as favourite paths and locations as well as routes they have discovered.}
